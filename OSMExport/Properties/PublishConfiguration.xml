# OSM Export

Exports your city to the OpenStreetMap XML format. To do this, go to settings and click the "Export OSM" button.
This creates a file in the AppData\LocalLow\Colossal Order\Cities Skylines II\ModsData\OSMExport folder.
The export process might take up to a minute.

## How to open OSM files

This mod does not render the XML files to images. You must do that yourself.

### Maperitive

The easiest way is to use a program called [Maperitive](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Maperitive).
However, by default, Maperitive does not render many map features contained in the XML files such as commercial zones.
I have created a custom rule set that includes rendering rules for all map features generated by the OSM Export mod here: https://gist.github.com/fergusq/78df44a41289e53e8348724916618d3c
To install the rule set, download the OSMExport.mrules file, put it to the Rules folder inside the Maperitive directory,
and type the following command to the Maperitive command prompt at the bottom of the Maperitive window:

use-ruleset location=Rules/OSMExport.mrules as-alias=osmexport

The OSM Export creates the city at the origo (latitude 0° and longitude 0°). If your city is filled with sea, remember to remove the Web Map source from the bottom right of the Maperitive window.

### JOSM

The [Java OpenStreetMap editor](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/JOSM) is a tool for editing OSM files, not displaying them.
You can use it to correct mistakes made by OSM Export.

Assume you want to change the type of a road from residential road to primary road.
Open the OSM file in JOSM, find the correct road segment ("way" in OSM talk) and change its highway tag from highway=residential to highway=primary.
See the [OSM wiki page](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:highway) for a list of all road types.

### Tilemaker

[Tilemaker](https://github.com/systemed/tilemaker) can render OSM files to vector tile formats. It produces a nice Google Maps-ish look for the map.
